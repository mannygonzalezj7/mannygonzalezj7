            "description":"This project is the concepts of a rock, paper, scissors game in HTML and JavaScript. From this project, I practiced the use of console inputs and prompts. The project is primarily coded in JavaScript, using functions, variables (both global and local), and recursion. The project itself was a simple outline by Odin Project, but I extended it to catch all exceptions, including null exceptions. So far, the game is still played in console, but in the future I plan to have an interactive user interface made with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. This game was good practice for the basics of JavaScript, and a good reminder that debugging is very important for making sure everything works properly!"
