The project is primarily coded in JavaScript, using functions, variables (both global and local), and recursion. The project itself was a simple outline by Odin Project, but I extended it to catch all exceptions, including null exceptions. So far, the game is still played in console, but in the future I plan to have an interactive user interface made with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. This game was good practice for the basics of JavaScript, and a good reminder that debugging is very important for making sure everything works properly!"

We decided to tackle the project in HTML, CSS and JavaScript using Edamam's Recipe Search API, as well as Firebase for authentication. The styling was made to look modern and sleek, in order to appeal to our target audiences."
